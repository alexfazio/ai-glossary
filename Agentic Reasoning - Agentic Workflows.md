### Overview

Agentic workflows refer to a new way of interacting with large language models (LLMs) where multiple instances of LLM performs actions in an iterative way, rather than just responding to a single prompt.

The concept of "Agentic Workflows" refers to a more iterative and multi-step approach to using large language models (LLMs) and AI Agents to perform tasks, as opposed to the traditional "non-agent" approach of providing a prompt and receiving a single, direct response.

### Agentic Workflows Design Patterns

Agentic workflows, like in programming can abide to different design patterns.

Here are some popular design patterns for agentic workflows:

- Reflection: An LLM can be prompted to reflect on its own code, identify bugs, and fix them.
- Planning: An LLM can be prompted to break down a complex task into smaller steps, then execute those steps.
- Multi-agent collaboration: An LLM can be prompted to collaborate with other LLMs, each playing a different role. For example, one LLM could act as a coder, while another acts as a reviewer.
- Multi-tool use: An LLM can be combined with other tools to achieve a goal. For example, an LLM could be prompted to use a web search engine to find information, then use that information to complete a task.
