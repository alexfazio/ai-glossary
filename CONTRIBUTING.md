## Guidelines

- To propose specific changes to a glossary entry, edit that entry in your branch and issue a pull request.
- To request that an entry be clarified, updated or reconsidered, you may alternatively open an issue.
- To propose a new entry to the glossary, either create an issue or, if you have the definition drafted, add the entry to your branch (in its proper alphabetical location) and create a pull request.

## Issues & Pull Requests

- Please jump in and help us out by reviewing open issues and making pull requests to resolve them.
- If you see anything you think can be improved, feel free to open an issue or, even, better submit your suggestions via a pull request.
- Please title your pull requests appropriately, summing up what your commits are about.
- For new terms, make sure that your entry doesn't already exist somewhere else in the glossary.

Requests:

- For glossary entry changes and additions, please raise separate pull requests for each entry. This makes it easier to discuss and shepherd updates in self-contained units.
- Please provide links to third party uses that support your issue or pull request.

## Philosophy

- The A to Z of AI seeks to be concise, including words that are unique to Artificial Intelligence, or which have different meanings when used in an AI context.

## Descriptive vs Prescriptive

- In most circumstances, the definition of a term should be based on empirical evidence of contemporary usage as published in literature, academic articles, talks and white papers.
- In some cases, a term will suffer from conflation, imprecise usage, or, even worse, outright conflicting defintions. In these cases, the Glossary Committers will consider proposed clarifications or focused definitions on a case-by-case basis.
