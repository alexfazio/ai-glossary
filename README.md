This glossary is a knowledge base that aims to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts accessible and understandable to a wide audience. 🌟 Our mission is to break down complex AI concepts and make them understandable for everyone, regardless of their technical background. 🎓💡

In this repository, you'll find:

- 📚 Clear and concise explanations of essential AI terms and concepts
- 🖼️ Engaging visuals, diagrams, and interactive elements to enhance learning
- 💻 Code snippets and examples to bridge theory and practice
- 🔍 Reliable citations and references to dive deeper into each topic
- 🌐 Open-source collaboration to ensure the glossary stays up-to-date and accurate

### Style Guide 🦋

Each entry in the glossary MUST include the following at a minimum:

1. **Concise explanation** - as short as possible, but no shorter
2. **Citations** - Papers, Tutorials, etc.

Excellent entries will also include:

1. **Visuals** - diagrams, charts, animations, images
2. **Code** - python/numpy snippets, classes, or functions
3. **Equations** - Formatted with Latex

### Goal 🎯

The goal of the glossary is to present content in the most accessible way possible, with a heavy emphasis on visuals and interactive diagrams. That said, in the spirit of rapid prototyping, it's okay to to submit a "rough draft" without visuals or code. We expect other readers will enhance your submission over time.

Join us on this exciting journey to demystify AI and make it accessible to all! 🚀🌟
