# AI Glossary in Plain Language

This glossary is a comprehensive knowledge base that aims to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts accessible and understandable to a wide audience, including developers, system owners, buyers, and users. By providing clear explanations of AI terminology and focusing on responsible AI development, it promotes a broader understanding of AI among both technical and non-technical individuals.

Covering essential topics such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, explainability, fairness, and ethical considerations, AI Concepts in Plain Language serves as a solid foundation for anyone interested in understanding and engaging with this rapidly evolving field. By bridging the gap between technical expertise and general understanding, this glossary contributes to the responsible development and application of AI across various domains.

### Style Guide

Each entry in the glossary MUST include the following at a minimum:

1. **Concise explanation** - as short as possible, but no shorter
2. **Citations** - Papers, Tutorials, etc.

Excellent entries will also include:

1. **Visuals** - diagrams, charts, animations, images
2. **Code** - python/numpy snippets, classes, or functions
3. **Equations** - Formatted with Latex

The goal of the glossary is to present content in the most accessible way possible, with a heavy emphasis on visuals and interactive diagrams. That said, in the spirit of rapid prototyping, it's okay to to submit a "rough draft" without visuals or code. We expect other readers will enhance your submission over time.
