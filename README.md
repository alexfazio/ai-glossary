### Style Guide ✒️

Each entry in the glossary MUST include the following at a minimum:

1. **Concise explanation** - as short as possible, but no shorter
2. **Citations** - Papers, Tutorials, etc.

Excellent entries will also include:

1. **Visuals** - diagrams, charts, animations, images
2. **Code** - python/numpy snippets, classes, or functions
3. **Equations** - Formatted with Latex


### Reasonably Substantive and Accurate

Entries must be both reasonably substantive as well as reasonably accurate. This means that entries should be:

- Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)
- Accurately portray the state of research and the relevant literature (i.e. not inaccurate, misleading or false)

### Goal 🎯

The goal of the glossary is to present content in the most accessible way possible, with a heavy emphasis on visuals and interactive diagrams. That said, in the spirit of rapid prototyping, it's okay to to submit a "rough draft" without visuals or code. We expect other readers will enhance your submission over time.
