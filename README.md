This glossary is a comprehensive knowledge base that aims to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts accessible and understandable to a wide audience. By providing clear explanations of AI terminology, it promotes a broader understanding of AI among **both technical and non-technical individuals**.

Covering essential topics such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, explainability, fairness, and ethical considerations, The A to Z of AI serves as a solid foundation for anyone interested in understanding and engaging with this rapidly evolving field. By bridging the gap between technical expertise and general understanding, this glossary contributes to the responsible development and application of AI across various domains.

The Open Glossary is governed as an open source project using a transparent and meritocratic process. Anybody can make additions, clarifications and suggestions by raising a GitHub issue or editing a branch and issuing a pull request. Each issue or pull request is evaluated by the community for inclusion.

#### Style Guide ðŸ¦‹

Each entry in the glossary MUST include the following at a minimum:

1. **Concise explanation** - as short as possible, but no shorter
2. **Citations** - Papers, Tutorials, etc.

Excellent entries will also include:

1. **Visuals** - diagrams, charts, animations, images
2. **Code** - python/numpy snippets, classes, or functions
3. **Equations** - Formatted with Latex

The goal of the glossary is to present content in the most accessible way possible, with a heavy emphasis on visuals and interactive diagrams. That said, in the spirit of rapid prototyping, it's okay to to submit a "rough draft" without visuals or code. We expect other readers will enhance your submission over time.
