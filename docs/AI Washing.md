After being warned about “[greenwashing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing)”, companies are now being told not to engage in **ai-washing**, or claiming a product or service has been created with artificial intelligence when it has not.

Examples of companies that have failed to mention humans pulling the levers behind supposedly cutting-edge AI technology. To name just a few:
- Amazon's AI-based 'just walk out' checkout tech [was powered by 1,000 Indian workers](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-03/the-humans-behind-amazon-s-just-walk-out-technology-are-all-over-ai) manually..
- Facebook [famously shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16856654/facebook-m-shutdown-bots-ai) its text-based virtual assistant M in 2018 after more than two years, during which the company used human workers to train (and operate) its underlying artificial intelligence system.
- A startup called x.ai, which marketed an “AI personal assistant” that scheduled meetings, [had humans doing that work instead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-18/the-humans-hiding-behind-the-chatbots) and shut down in 2021 after it struggled to get to a point where the algorithms could work independently.
- A British startup called Builder.ai sold AI software that could build apps even though it [partly relied on](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-startup-boom-raises-questions-of-exaggerated-tech-savvy-11565775004) software developers in India and elsewhere to do that work, according to a _Wall Street Journal_ report.

[Pseudo AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/04/04/artificial-or-human-intelligence-companies-faking-ai/) or “AI washing” was widespread even before the recent generative AI boom.

This "AI washing" threatens to overinflate expectations for the technology, undermining public trust and potentially setting up the booming field for a backlash.
