[Agentic Workflows](./Agentic%20Workflows.md), like in programming can abide to different design patterns.

Here are some popular design patterns for agentic workflows:

- [Reflection](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1773393357022298617): The LLM examines its own work to come up with ways to improve it. 
- [Tool use](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1775951610059141147): The LLM is given tools such as web search, code execution, or any other function to help it gather information, take action, or process data. 
- [Planning](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1779606380665803144): The LLM comes up with, and executes, a multistep plan to achieve a goal (for example, writing an outline for an essay, then doing online research, then writing a draft, and so on). 
- [Multi-agent collaboration](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/1780991671855161506): More than one AI agent work together, splitting up tasks and discussing and debating ideas, to come up with better solutions than a single agent would. [^1]
