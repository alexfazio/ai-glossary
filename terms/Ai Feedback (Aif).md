AI Feedback refers to the mechanisms and processes by which these models receive, integrate, and respond to user inputs, corrections, or other forms of feedback to improve accuracy, relevancy, and safety of their outputs. This often involves techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where models are fine-tuned based on evaluations of their performance against human judgment or preferences.
