A type of model that generates text one token at a time. It is auto-regressive because it uses its own predictions to generate the next token. For example, the model might receive as input "Today's weather" and generate the next token, "is". It will then use "Today's weather is" as input and generate the next token, "sunny". It will then use "Today's weather is sunny" as input and generate the next token, "and". And so on.
