A pre-trained model is not specifically trained to "behave" in a conversational manner. If you try to use a base model (e.g. GPT-3, Mistral, Llama) directly to do conversations, it won't work as well as the fine-tuned conversational variant (ChatGPT, Mistral Instruct, Llama Chat). When looking at benchmarks, you want to compare base models with base models and conversational models with conversational models.
