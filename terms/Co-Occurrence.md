A co-occurrence commonly refers to the presence of different elements in the same document. It is often used in business intelligence to heuristically recognize patterns and guess associations between concepts that are not naturally connected (e.g., the name of an investor often mentioned in articles about startups successfully closing funding rounds could be interpreted as the investor is particularly good at picking his or her investments.).
