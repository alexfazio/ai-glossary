Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity of two vectors. Specifically, it measures the similarity in the direction or orientation of the vectors ignoring differences in their magnitude or scale. Both vectors need to be part of the same inner product space, meaning they must produce a scalar through inner product multiplication. The similarity of two vectors is measured by the cosine of the angle between them.[^1]
