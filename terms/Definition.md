Parameters are numerical values adjusted during pre-training and fine-tuning phases.
Scale Indication: Represented by figures like 7b, 13b, and 34b, indicating billions of parameters.
Importance: While a higher parameter count typically suggests better model performance due to finer text pattern representation, it is not the sole factor; the quality and quantity of training data also significantly influence effectiveness.
ollama: An open-source tool to run LLMs locally. There are multiple web/desktop apps and terminal integrations on top of it.
