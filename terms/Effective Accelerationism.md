Effective accelerationism, often abbreviated as "e/acc", is a 21st-century philosophical movement that advocates for an explicitly pro-technology stance. Its proponents believe that unrestricted technological progress (especially driven by artificial intelligence) is a solution to universal human problems like poverty, war and climate change. They see themselves as a counterweight to more cautious views on technological innovation, often giving their opponents the derogatory labels of "doomers" or "decels" (short for deceleration). [^1]

Advocates of effective accelerationism promote a perspective that not only should the advancement of artificial intelligence be permitted to continue without restrictions, but it should also be expedited. [^2]

Leading the charge of e/acc is [Marc Andreessen](../Marc%20Andreessen.md), co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm. [^2]
