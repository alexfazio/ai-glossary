“[Effective altruism](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/11/15/the-good-delusion-has-effective-altruism-broken-bad)”, a movement that is concerned by the possibility of ai wiping out all of humanity. [^1]

Both are pillars of “longtermism,” a growing strain of the ideology known as effective altruism (or EA), which is popular among an elite slice of people in tech and [politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/style/david-shor-democrats.html). [^2]

Since its birth in the late 2000s, effective altruism has aimed to answer the question “How can those with means have the _most_ impact on the world in a quantifiable way?”—and supplied clear methodologies for calculating the answer.[^2]

“[Longtermism](https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo),” the belief that unlikely but existential threats like a humanity-destroying AI revolt or international biological warfare are humanity’s most pressing problems, is integral to EA today. [^2]
