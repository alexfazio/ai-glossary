Training a model on a small (labeled) dataset to learn a specific task. This is done after pre-training. Imagine you have a few dollars, as a good fellow GPU-Poor. Rather than training a model from scratch, you pick a pre-trained (base) model and fine-tune it. You usually pick a small dataset of few hundreds-thousands of samples. You then pass it to the model and train it on it. This is called fine-tuning. The idea is to end with a model that has a strong understanding of a specific task. Examples of fine-tuned models are ChatGPT, Vicuna, and Mistral Instruct.
