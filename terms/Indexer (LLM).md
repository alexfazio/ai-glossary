An indexer in the context of LLMs (Large Language Models) refers to tools that help manage and organise data for efficient querying and retrieval by LLMs. Two such tools are LlamaIndex and LangChain.

[LlamaIndex](../LlamaIndex.md), previously known as GPT Index, is a data framework specifically designed for LLM apps. Its primary focus is on ingesting, structuring, and accessing private or domain-specific data. It offers a set of tools that facilitate the integration of custom data into LLMs. LlamaIndex is optimized for index querying and supports vector embeddings, making it an ideal solution for applications requiring indexing and retrieval capabilities[^2].

[LangChain](../LangChain.md) is a more general-purpose framework that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. It provides tools for loading, processing, and indexing data, as well as for interacting with LLMs. Langchain is also more flexible than LlamaIndex, allowing users to work with different types of data and LLMs[^2].

Both LlamaIndex and LangChain can be used together to enhance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. LlamaIndex is particularly suitable for indexing and retrieval, while LangChain provides a more general-purpose framework for building applications with LLMs[^2].
