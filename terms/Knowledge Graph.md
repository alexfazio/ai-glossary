A knowledge graph is a graph of concepts whose value resides in its ability to meaningfully represent a portion of reality, specialized or otherwise. Every concept is linked to at least one other concept, and the quality of this connection can belong to different classes (see: taxonomies). The interpretation of every concept is represented by its links. Consequently, every node is the concept it represents only based on its position in the graph (e.g., the concept of an apple, the fruit, is a node whose parents are “apple tree”, “fruit”, etc.). Advanced knowledge graphs can have many properties attached to a node including the words used in language to represent a concept (e.g., “apple” for the concept of an apple), if it carries a particular sentiment in a culture (“bad”, “beautiful”) and how it behaves in a sentence.
