A pre-trained model trained by Meta, shared with some groups in a private access, and then leaked. It led to an explosion of cool projects.

A language model series created by Meta. Llama 1 was originally leaked in February 2023; Llama 2 then officially released later that year with openly available model weights & a permissive license. Kicked off the initial wave of open source developments that have been made when it comes to open source language modeling. The Llama series comes in four distinct sizes: 7b, 13b, 34b (only Code Llama was released for Llama 2 34b), and 70b. As of writing, the hotly anticipated Llama 3 has yet to arrive.
