Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as “training data,” in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In NLP, ML-based solutions can quickly cover the entire scope of a problem (or, at least of a corpus used as sample data), but are demanding in terms of the work required to achieve production-grade accuracy.
