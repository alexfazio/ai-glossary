The degree to which an artificial intelligence model consistently produces accurate, dependable, and repeatable outputs or results. [^1]

System performance, reliability, and user confidence in AI model output is affected as much by the quality of the model design as the data going into it. [^2]

To achieve AI that is robust and reliable, companies need to ensure their AI algorithms produce the right results for each new data set. They also need established processes for handling issues and inconsistencies if and when they arise. The human factor is a critical element here: understanding how human input affects reliability; determining who the right people are to provide input; and ensuring those people are properly equipped and trainedâ€”particularly with regard to bias and ethics.
