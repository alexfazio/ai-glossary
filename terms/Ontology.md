An ontology is similar to a taxonomy, but it enhances its simple tree-like classification structure by adding properties to each node/element and connections between nodes that can extend to other branches. These properties are not standard, nor are they limited to a predefined set. Therefore, they must be agreed upon by the classifier and the user. Read our blog post “ Understanding Ontology and How It Adds Value to NLU” to learn more about the ontologies.
