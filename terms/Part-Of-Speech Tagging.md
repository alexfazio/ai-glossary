A Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger is an NLP function that identifies grammatical information about the elements of a sentence. Basic POS tagging can be limited to labeling every word by grammar type, while more complex implementations can group phrases and other elements in a clause, recognize different types of clauses, build a dependency tree of a sentence, and even assign a logical function to every word (e.g., subject, predicate, temporal adjunct, etc.).
