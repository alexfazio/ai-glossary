Training a model on a very large dataset (trillion of tokens) to learn the structure of language. Imagine you have millions of dollars, as a good GPU-Rich. You usually scrape big datasets from the internet and train your model on them. This is called pre-training. The idea is to end with a model that has a strong understanding of language. This does not require labeled data! This is done before fine-tuning. Examples of pre-trained models are GPT-3, Llama 2, and Mistral.
