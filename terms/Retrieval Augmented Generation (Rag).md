Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI technique for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by including trusted sources of knowledge, outside of the original training set, to improve the accuracy of the LLMâ€™s output. Implementing RAG in an LLM-based question answering system has benefits: 1) assurance that an LLM has access to the most current, reliable facts, 2) reduce hallucinations rates, and 3) provide source attribution to increase user trust in the output.
