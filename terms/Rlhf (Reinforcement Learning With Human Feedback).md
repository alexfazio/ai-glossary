A type of fine-tuning that uses reinforcement learning (RL) and human-generated feedback. Thanks to the introduction of human feedback, the end model ends up being very good for things such as conversations! It kicks off with a base model that generates bunch of conversations. Humans then rate the answers (preferences). The preferences are used to train a Reward Model that generates a score for a given text. Using Reinforcement Learning, the initial LM is trained to maximize the score generated by the Reward Model.
