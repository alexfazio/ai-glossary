Data that is stuctured in some way but does not obey the tablular structure of traditional databases or other conventional data tables most commonly organized in rows and columns. Attributes of the data are different even though they may be grouped together. A simple example is a form; a more advanced example is a object database where the data is represented in the form of objects that are related (e.g. automobile make relates to model relates to trim level).
