Sentiment analysis is an NLP function that identifies the sentiment in text. This can be applied to anything from a business document to a social media post. Sentiment is typically measured on a linear scale (negative, neutral or positive), but advanced implementations can categorize text in terms of emotions, moods, and feelings.
