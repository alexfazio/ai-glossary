A taxonomy is a predetermined group of classes of a subset of knowledge (e.g., animals, drugs, etc.). It includes dependencies between elements in a “part of” or “type of” relationship, giving itself a multi-level, tree-like structure made of branches (the final node or element of every branch is known as a leaf). This creates order and hierarchy among knowledge subsets. Companies use taxonomies to more concisely organize their documents which, in turn, enables internal or external users to more easily search for and locate the documents they need. They can be specific to a single company or become de-facto languages shared by companies across specific industries.
