A type of prompt that is used to generate text without fine-tuning. The model is not trained on any specific task. It is only trained on a large dataset of text. For example, you can give the model the first line of a poem and ask it to generate the rest of the poem. The model will do its best to generate a poem, even though it has never seen a poem before! When you use ChatGPT, you often do zero-shot generation!
